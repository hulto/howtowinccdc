### INJECT: Configure Printer

**Inject:** We've had new printers dropped off today, they need to be configured to work with out system. Please print a test message within 15 minutes and hand it to your White team member

**Suggested Solution:**\(Please submit suggestions on what worked for you in the issues\)

### INJECT: Inventory

**Inject:** The previous IT team did a poor job keeping the management informed on what the IT team was doing. As a result, we do not have a clear idea of what resources we currently have available. Please inventory every system, the accounts they poses, and the services they offer. Provide a summary report of all that you find. The report should list:

* System Name:
* Platform: \(Windows, Linux, Solaris, etc..\)
* Account List:
* Service List:

Please keep the report updated to reflect changes to our network. If any of this changes, then submit an updated report.

**Suggested Solution:**

* Since it's a one time inject, don't worry about the last bit. 
* For the services list, just list what ports are available or needed for scoring / business actions
* For the account list, just print out a `net user` or `cat /etc/passwd`, going fancier is probably a waste of time.
